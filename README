BUILDING
========
* Import the project into your eclipse workspace
* Choose "Build Jar" from the "External Tools" drop-down

RUNNING
=======
1. Single User Version:
    $ ./run-nompi.sh

2. P2PMPI Version

* Adapt lib/p2pmpi/P2P-MPI.conf to your needs
* Setup your environment (the source command will export P2PMPI_HOME and will
  put p2pmpi into your PATH):
    $ source ./setup-mpi.sh
* Start supernode and mpi node if necessary:
    $ runSuperNode
    $ mpiboot
* Run mpi version:
    $ ./run-mpi.sh

Both, the single and multi user versions accept the "-d" switch on the command
line, producing tons of debug output.

TESTS
=====
* Download mockito-all-1.8.5.jar from http://mockito.org/ and place the jar
  into lib/ext. Use eclipse to run the unit tests

DOCUMENTATION
=============
* Download UmlGraph-5.4.jar from http://www.umlgraph.org/ and place it into
  lib/ext. Use "ant -f deism-build-javadoc.xml" to build the documentation.
