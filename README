BUILDING
========
* Import the project into your eclipse workspace
* Choose "Build Jar" from the "External Tools" drop-down

RUNNING
=======

1. Single User Version
    $ ./run-nompi.sh

2. P2PMPI Version

* Adapt lib/p2pmpi/P2P-MPI.conf to your needs
* Setup your environment:
    $ source ./setup-mpi.sh
* Run mpi version:
    $ ./run-mpi.sh

Both, the single and multi user versions accept the "-d" switch on the command
line, producing tons of debug output.
