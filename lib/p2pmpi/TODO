BUGS:

- File locking is not implemented: 
  it should prevent an application A1 to remove from cache data that another application A2 may be using. 
  
  Discussion: could be implemented with an auxiliary lock file, e.g when f1 in cache is used, create a f1.lock
  file. We can turn this in a semaphore, setting an initial value 1 into it upon creation,  adding 1 each time
  an app. start using it, -1 each time it stops using it, and remove it if its value was 1.
  However, this solution has two drawbacks: 
  i) an application that crashes will not decrement the semaphore,
  ii) the increment of the semaphore value is not atomic



********************
* MPI implemenation 
********************
 - Status length (should be corrected)
 - Handle temporary connection lost <--(need to test)
 - Single port device <---- (wait to integrated)
 - performance asDoubleBuffer -> for(int i) putDouble

****************
* Visualization
****************
- how PEER_CACHE=/tmp/cache.xml in config_file is to be defined for windows (getTempDir() from java ?)

- remove dead nodes after a given timeout
- add a "Don't use cache" tick box, so to list application names
- implement computer characteristics (RAM, CPU, ...)  description for Windows (exists now for Linux, MacOs, Solaris)


****************
* FIXMEs
****************
Gather doesnt not work with INT2 yet
displacement in Datatype in C/C++/FORTRAN count as byte
but in Java we can't do that.
